/*
Fixed Values: If a value is fixed and does not vary between instances of a class,
defining it in the body makes sense because it does not need to be customized during each object instantiation.

Non-unique Attributes: Similarly, attributes that donâ€™t contribute to the uniqueness or essential characteristics of the objects can also be defined in the body.
These values might not be essential for constructing a meaningful instance of the class.
